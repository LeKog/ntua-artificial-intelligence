## Lab1 : Search Algorithms

Students were asked to create mazes and then implement and compare search algorithms such as A*, Best-First, Dijkstra 
using different heuristic functions in order to
solve the mazes. In the final part , we had to use the Alpha-Beta algorithm and find appropriate heuristic functions for it so that we can
solve the maze while being hunted by an opposing player.


## Lab2 :  Simple Movie Recommendation System using Prolog

Students were asked to study some .csv files containing data about movies (title, director, actors etc) and create Prolog literals 
(using pyswip)
to create
a database which can be used for a very basic movie recommendation system. After training our model with some user's reviews we tested it's
efficiency.


## Lab3 :  More Advanced Movie Recommendation System using Decision Trees

Again after studying some .csv files students were asked to find statistic correlations between the different attributes of our movie database
and some user's reviews. In order to create a movie recommender we had to implement Cart's Decision Tree Algorithm and test different decision 
trees trying to achieve the best accuracy we could. Finally, we compared our model to sklearn's Random Forest.
